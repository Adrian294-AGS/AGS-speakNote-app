# App Idea: SpeakNotes — Voice-to-Structured-NotesApp

What is it?

An app where users can record short voice notes, and the app transcribes and automatically organizes the content into clean, structured written notes.

Think:
“I just learned about closures in JavaScript…” → app turns that into a labeled, searchable, tagged text note in seconds.
